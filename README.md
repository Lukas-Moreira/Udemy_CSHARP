# 📚 C# Course Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository of C# projects developed during my journey through the **C# programming course**. Each subfolder contains an individual, functional application designed to explore key programming concepts and techniques in .NET.

This repository is a growing collection of mini-projects ranging from basic console apps to object-oriented simulations.

## 🧱 Structure

Each folder in this repository is an independent C# project with its own purpose, logic, and `README.md`. Below is a summary of the currently available projects:

### 🔹 [`Bank`](./Bank/)
A simple banking system that allows account creation, deposits, and withdrawals. Uses a custom logging system and terminal banner.  
📌 *Focus: OOP, encapsulation, user input validation*

### 🔹 [`Pensionato`](./Pensionato/)
A guesthouse room rental system where the user registers client data and assigns rooms. Includes email validation and stylized CLI output.  
📌 *Focus: Arrays, input handling, classes, constructor overloading*

🧠 Purpose
This repository serves as:

- A learning tracker of my C# development journey
